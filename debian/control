Description: Debian packaging of JupyterHub, a multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
    .
    With JupyterHub you can create a multi-user Hub which spawns,
    manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user
    Jupyter notebook server.
    .
    Project Jupyter created JupyterHub to support many users.
    The Hub can offer notebook servers to a class of students,
    a corporate data science workgroup, a scientific research
    project, or a high performance computing group.
    .
    This is a self-contained Python3 venv wrapped into a Debian package
    (an "omnibus" package, all passengers on board).
